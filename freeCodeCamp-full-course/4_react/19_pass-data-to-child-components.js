/* Pass State as Props to Child Components
You saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.

For example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.

This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is unidirectional data flow. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.

-------------------------------

Exercise: The MyApp component is stateful and renders a Navbar component as a child. Pass the name property in its state down to the child component, then show the name in the h1 tag that's part of the Navbar render method. name should appear after the text Hello, my name is: . */

class MyApp extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            name: 'CamperBot'
        }
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                {/* Change code below this line */}
                <Navbar name={this.state.name} />
                {/* Change code above this line */}
            </div>
        );
    }
};

class Navbar extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                {/* Change code below this line */}
                <h1>Hello, my name is: {this.props.name}</h1>
                {/* Change code above this line */}
            </div>
        );
    }
};


// =========================

/* Pass a Callback as Props
You can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.

-------------------------------

Exercise: There are three components outlined in the code editor. The MyApp component is the parent that will render the GetInput and RenderInput child components. Add the GetInput component to the render method in MyApp, then pass it a prop called input assigned to inputValue from MyApp's state. Also create a prop called handleChange and pass the input handler handleChange to it.

Next, add RenderInput to the render method in MyApp, then create a prop called input and pass the inputValue from state to it. Once you are finished you will be able to type in the input field in the GetInput component, which then calls the handler method in its parent via props. This updates the input in the state of the parent, which is passed as props to both children. Observe how the data flows between the components and how the single source of truth remains the state of the parent component. Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but should serve to illustrate how data and callbacks can be passed between React components. */

class MyApp extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            inputValue: ''
        }
        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }
    handleChange(event) {
        this.setState({
            inputValue: event.target.value
        });
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                { /* Change code below this line */}
                <GetInput input={this.state.inputValue} handleChange={this.handleChange} />
                <RenderInput input={this.state.inputValue} />
                { /* Change code above this line */}
            </div>
        );
    }
};

class GetInput extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h3>Get Input:</h3>
                <input
                    value={this.props.input}
                    onChange={this.props.handleChange} />
            </div>
        );
    }
};

class RenderInput extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h3>Input Render:</h3>
                <p>{this.props.input}</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
};
