/* Target Elements by Class Using jQuery
You see how we made all of your button elements bounce? We selected them with $("button"), then we added some CSS classes to them with .addClass("animated bounce");.

You just used jQuery's .addClass() function, which allows you to add classes to elements.

First, let's target your div elements with the class well by using the $(".well") selector.

Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a . before the class's name.

Then use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and shake.

For example, you could make all the elements with the class text-primary shake by adding the following to your document ready function:

$(".text-primary").addClass("animated shake"); */
