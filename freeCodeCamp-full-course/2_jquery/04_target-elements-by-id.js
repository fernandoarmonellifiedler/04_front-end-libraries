/* Target Elements by id Using jQuery
You can also target elements by their id attributes.

First target your button element with the id target3 by using the $("#target3") selector.

Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a # before the id's name.

Then use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and fadeOut.

Here's how you'd make the button element with the id target6 fade out:

$("#target6").addClass("animated fadeOut"). */
