/* Create a Bootstrap Button
Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.

Create a new button element below your large kitten photo. Give it the btn and btn-default classes, as well as the text of Like. 

<button class='btn btn-default'>Like</button>

=============================
Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button
Normally, your button elements with the btn and btn-default classes are only as wide as the text that they contain. For example:

<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>

This button would only be as wide as the word Submit.

(button example)

By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.

<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>

This button would take up 100% of the available width.

(button example)

Note that these buttons still need the btn class.

Add Bootstrap's btn-block class to your Bootstrap button.

=============================
Taste the Bootstrap Button Color Rainbow
The btn-primary class is the main color you'll use in your app. It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take.

Replace Bootstrap's btn-default class with btn-primary in your button.

Note that this button will still need the btn and btn-block classes.

<button class="btn btn-primary btn-block">Like</button>

=============================
Call out Optional Actions with btn-info
Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-info class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.

Create a new block-level Bootstrap button below your Like button with the text Info, and add Bootstrap's btn-info and btn-block classes to it.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.

  <button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>
  <button class='btn btn-block btn-info'>Info</button>

=============================
Warn Your Users of a Dangerous Action with btn-danger
Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-danger class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a cat photo.

Create a button with the text Delete and give it the class btn-danger.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.

<button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button>
