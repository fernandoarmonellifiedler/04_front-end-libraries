/* Make Images Mobile Responsive
First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats.

It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.

Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page.


<img class='img-responsive' src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats"/>
